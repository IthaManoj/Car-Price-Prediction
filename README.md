 ## Problem Statement :
  We need to advise a person who wishes to buy a used car by conveying the specifications needed by the customers like brand, mileage, year of purchase and some other features so that we can convey him the approximate price of the car.
  
  
We have used Linear Regression to develop the model and the data has been extracted from the kaggle.
